            <div class="section-title">The Beginning - Grade 6</div>
            <p>My journey into programming and shooting began in grade 6, but not in the way you might expect. Ironically, I <span class="highlight">hated attending computer lectures</span> during this time. I was afraid of computers, and when we learned HTML, I didn't understand it at all. All of my classmates were much faster than me when it came to typing. At the time, I was more of a car guy. I would draw cars, play racing games, and focus on anything related to automobiles.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <div class="section-title">Discovering Shooting</div>
            <p>Around this time, my mother sent me to an <span class="highlight">army camp</span>, where they taught me archery and target shooting, among other things. I quickly developed an interest in shooting and expressed my desire to do it regularly. When I learned that rifle shooting was an actual sport, I became even more excited. I began practicing at <span class="highlight">Mulund Gymkhana</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Within 2â€“3 months, a DSO shooting competition came up, for which my coach encouraged me to go. Not from a winning perspective, but more from a learning perspective. It was my first shooting competition, and of course, I performed poorly. My score was around <span class="highlight">32 out of 400</span>. While disappointed, I continued practicing.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <div class="section-title">Impact of COVID-19</div>
            <p>When <span class="highlight">COVID-19 struck in February 2020</span>, everyone was trapped at home for two years. Due to the lockdown, I was unable to continue training. At the same time, my 7th grade school year was entirely online. This became a turning point for me, as I started to explore programming.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <div class="section-title">Introduction to Programming</div>
            <p>During the second half of grade 7, my schoolmates introduced me to a popular social media platform called <span class="highlight">Discord</span>. Initially, I was confused by the interface and had no idea how the bots worked. However, my curiosity pushed me to understand how they operated. I searched online and found various codes to create Discord bots. After a few months of copying and modifying other people's codes, I tried writing my own code.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That's when I discovered <span class="highlight">aoi.js</span> (formerly dbd.js). I got good at it pretty quickly and soon started taking active part in their discord server. I would help other beginners with their aoi.js-related doubts. However, I wanted to contribute something more significant, I wanted to give back to the amazing open-source community that taught me programming.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I began coding dashboards for Discord bots, and my work was noticed by the aoi.js team. They offered me to contribute to their project, I became the <span class="highlight">lead developer of @aoijs/aoi.panel</span>, an easy-to-use UI for aoi.js. This was a huge milestone in my programming journey.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When my parents heard that I was doing programming, they were upset at first. But I was able to convince them that I was doing it for a positive and meaningful cause.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <div class="section-title">Returning to Shooting</div>
            <p>The lockdown was eventually called off, and life returned to normal. Unfortunately, I was not permitted to resume shooting in 9th and 10th grade, as these grades were precious years in academics.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I continued shooting in 11th grade, and after only four months, I was playing my first nationals. I trained daily for four hours, and the hard work paid off. I won my <span class="highlight">first national medal</span> in shooting.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="content-section">
            <div class="section-title">The Future</div>
            <p>Currently, I've shifted categories in rifle shooting, meaning I'm almost starting over, but the grind continues. Both programming and shooting have shaped who I am today, and I remain determined to keep pushing forward in both fields.</p>
