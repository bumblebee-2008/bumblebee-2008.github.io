            My journey into programming and shooting began in grade 6, but not in the way you might expect. Ironically, I hated attending computer lectures during this time. I was afraid of computers, and when we learned HTML, I didn’t understand it at all. All of my classmates were much faster than me when it came to typing.At the time, I was more of a car guy. I would draw cars, play racing games, and focus on anything related to automobiles.<br><br>

            <span class="text-xl font-bold my-16">Discovering Shooting:</span>
            <br><br>
            Around this time,my mother sent me to an army camp, where they taught me archery and target shooting, among other things. I quickly developed an interest in shooting and expressed my desire to do it regularly. When I learned that rifle shooting was an actual sport, I became even more excited. I began practicing at Mulund Gymkhana.  Within 2–3 months, a DSO shooting competition came up, for which my coach encouraged me to go. Not from a winning perspective, but more from a learning perspective. It was my first shooting competition, and of course, I performed poorly. My score was around 32 out of 400. While disappointed, I continued practicing.<br><br>

            <span class="text-xl font-bold">Impact of COVID-19:</span><br><br>

            When COVID-19 struck in February 2020, everyone was trapped at home for two years. Due to the lockdown, I was unable to continue training. At the same time, my 7th grade school year was entirely online. This became a turning point for me, as I started to explore programming.<br><br>

            <span class="text-xl font-bold"> Introduction to Programming:</span><br><br>

            During the second half of grade 7, my schoolmates introduced me to a popular social media platform called Discord. Initially, I was confused by the interface and had no idea how the bots worked. However, my curiosity pushed me to understand how they operated. I searched online and found various codes to create Discord bots. After a few months of copying and modifying other people's codes, I tried writing my own code.<br>

            That's when I discovered aoi.js (formerly dbd.js). I got good at it pretty quickly and soon started taking active part in their discord server. I would help other beginners with their aoi.js-related doubts. However,  I wanted to contribute something more significant, I wanted to give back to the amazing open-source community that taught me programming.<br><br>
            I began coding dashboards for Discord bots, and my work was noticed by the aoi.js team. They offered me to contribute to their project, I became the lead developer of @aoijs/aoi.panel, an easy-to-use UI for aoi.js. This was a huge milestone in my programming journey.<br><br>

            When my parents heard that I was doing programming, they were upset at first. But I was able to convince them that I was doing it for a positive and meaningful cause.<br><br>

            <span class="text-xl font-bold">Returning to Shooting:</span><br><br>
            The lockdown was eventually called off, and life returned to normal. Unfortunately, I was not permitted to resume shooting in 9th and 10th grade, as these grades were precious years in academics.<br>
            I continued shooting in 11th grade, and after only four months, I was playing my first nationals. I trained daily for four hours, and the hard work paid off. I won my first national medal in shooting.
            <br><br>
            <span class="text-xl font-bold">The Future:</span><br><br>

            Currently, I’ve shifted categories in rifle shooting, meaning I’m almost starting over, but the grind continues. Both programming and shooting have shaped who I am today, and I remain determined to keep pushing forward in both fields.
